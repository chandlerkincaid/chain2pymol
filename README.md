This program is a simple text parser for taking CHAIN statistics, such as conservation, and mapping them to a PDB file so that those values can be visualized in 3D.

Download chain2pymol.py, change the permission to executable, and run chain2pymol.py --help in the terminal for further instructions.

This program has only been tested with of CHAIN 1.0.0 and LibreOffice 5.2.2.2 . If it does not work in your environment you may be able to fix it by reading the documentation in the python file and tweaking some values.
